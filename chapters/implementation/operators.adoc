Installation is straight forward using the ((OpenShift Data Foundation Operator)), which includes a wizard to create a storage subsystem. 

During the wizard you are presented with a choice of using an existing storage class, local storage, or connecting to an existing ceph cluster. You also have the option to taint the nodes, to be dedicated storage nodes.

For in depth information on installing ODF see the documentation.
