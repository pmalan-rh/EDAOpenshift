= Installing Operators

Creation of the infrastructure, and Camel K, we are going to use OpenShift operators. Most of these operators provides a quick start, which we are going to use for installation.

To access the quick starts available, from the Openshift Consolse, in Administrator perspective, got to Home->Overview, and under "Getting Started resources", you will see the link "View all quick starts". 

== Openshift Data Foundation (Optional)

Installation is straight forward using the ((OpenShift Data Foundation Operator)), which includes a wizard to create a storage subsystem. 

During the wizard you are presented with a choice of using an existing storage class, local storage, or connecting to an existing ceph cluster. You also have the option to taint the nodes, to be dedicated storage nodes.

For in depth information on installing ODF see the documentation.

== Serverless Operator

Configuring the OpenShift Serverless environment requires the installation of the ((OpenShift Serverless Operator)), and the configuration of the KNative and KServing deployments. For our needs we are going to use defaults, but keep in mind that customized configuration can be done.

Use the "Install the Openshift Serverless Operator" Quick start wizard to complete the installation.

To install the ((Red Hat Camel K Operator)):

- From the *Administrator* perspective, got to the OperatorHub from the Operators section of the navigation pane.
- In the *All Items* filter, type in *Camel K*
- Click the Red Hat Integration - Camel K tile, to open the Operator details
- At the top of Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator panel, click Install

- After a few minutes, you will get a confirmation that Operator is ready for use. 

****
[WARNING]
If you running into an issue deploying Camel K Operator, where the deployment fails with a ImagePullBackOff error. You can view the progress on the issue at the following link:
https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENTESB-19495?focusedCommentId=20637854&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-20637854

As a workaround, we are going to patch the Camel K Cluster Service Version, to pull the operator image based on version, not hash:

- Operators->Installed Operators->Red Hat Integration - Camel K->YAML Tab:

- On Line: 423 - replace registry.redhat.io/integration/camel-k-rhel8-operator:1.6.8

- Save the change

- Delete the camel-k-operator deployment, under Deployments, project openshift-operators to force a redploy, with corrected iamge.
