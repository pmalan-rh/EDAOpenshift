= Service Registry 

== Installing Service Registry

The service registry requires persistence storage, in the form of an RDBMS or KafkaSQL.

Since we have our kafka instance, we are going to use that.

=== Getting Kafka Bootstrap Server Endpoint

- From *Administrator* perspective, click on *Projects* under *Home*
- Select *amq-streaams* from the projects 
- On the *Inventory* panel, click on *Services*
- Click on *my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap* service
- On the right hand-side, under *Service Routing*, take note of the *Hostname*
- Also note the ports, under *Service port mapping*, the one we are interested in is the tcp-clients 9092.

.Bootstrap Server Endpoint for my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap
my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.amq-streams.svc:9092

[NOTE]
====
The service hostname is determined by service and project (namespace), appended with svc.cluster.local.

The 'cluser.local' is added automatically,as it is the default local domain name, so typically it is dropped from service endpoints, if used internal to OpenShift. 
====

Next up, we have to create a namespace for Service Registry.

- From the *Administrator* perspective, go to *Projects* from the *Home* section of the navigation pane.
- On the list of projects, click on *Create Project*
- Call the namespace *service-registry* and give a description, and click on *Create* namespace
- Go to the *Installed Operators*, under *Operators* heading
- Select *Red Hat Integration - Service Registry Operator* from the operator list
- On the *Apicurio Registry* pane, click *Create Instance*
- Select the *YAML view* option in the *Configure via:* choice
- Change the *name:* to service-registry
- Replace <service name> with *my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap*
- Replace <namespace> with *amq-streams*
- Clicnk on *Create*

== Testing to Registry

By default, there would be a route created to expose the registry to the outside world.

In order to get the external facing registry UI:

- From *Administrator* perspective, go to *Routes*, under *Networking* heading
- Click on the link displayed, next to the service-registry-ingress.

[warning]
****
It is always possible to remove the service, or add additional security on top of the Registry's web console.
