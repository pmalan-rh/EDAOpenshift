= Camel K 

== Integration Platform

The integration platform configuration controls the building and implementation of creating integrations.

For our demo, we are going to utilize a maven repository configured with mirrors, and we have to reference the maven's settings.xml in the integration platform.

We also going to change a couple of integration runtime traits. One setting, the logging color, cause a really bad output on an Openshift console, so we are going to change that, and the other setting is to enable tracing across all integrations and deployments, within the project.

=== Create Maven settings.xml and configmap

It is highly recommended that you setup a local maven repository for use by Camel K.

Several third party tools are available for setting up a mirror repository server, even with OpenShift Operators available like Nexus and Artifactory.

Here is a sample configuration to start with, containing all the required repositories for Camel K.

.Sample settings.xml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmalan-rh/EDAOpenShift-code/main/camel-k/settings.xml

From terminal, login into OpenShift and create the ConfigMap:

[code]
----
oc login -u _user_
cd ~/.m2
oc create configmap maven-settings --from-file=settings.xml -n eda-order-entry
----


=== Create Integration Platform

- Navigate to *Installed Operators* under *Operators*
- Confirm that the selected project is *eda-order-entry*
- Click on the *Red Hat Integration - Camel K*
- Click on the *Integration Platform* panel, *Create instance*
- Paste the following YAML:

.Raw yaml

- Click on *Create*

== Verification

To verify the installation of Camel K, is to look at the list Kamelets:

- Form *Administrator* perspective, go to *Installed Operators*, and select *Red Hat Integration - Camel K*
- Select the *Kamelet* tab
- You will see a list of kamelets, if install worked.
