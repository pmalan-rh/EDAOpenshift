== OpenShift Data Foundation Capabilities

OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) is an integrated collection of storage and data services for OpenShift.

== Role in EDA Platform

From an EDA Platform point of view, ODF gives us the capability to store information in a highly available replicated clustered environment on different types of storage types, block, file system and even Simple Storage System (S3), using native devices, or virtual devices offered by the underlying compute/cloud provider.
